Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for visiting our dental practice on your last visit. It was a pleasure meeting you and discussing your dental health concerns.

I appreciate you sharing your symptoms with us. Based on our consultation, you mentioned experiencing sensitivity in your lower left teeth, particularly when drinking cold water, along with some pain while chewing on that side. This discomfort has been consistent for the past two to three weeks. You also noted some bleeding when brushing your teeth, especially near your molars.

During the examination, I observed some plaque buildup along your lower molars and mild gum inflammation. There is also an old composite filling on your lower left first molar, which you had placed approximately five or six years ago. The probing revealed some gum inflammation, with BP scores of threes and fours in certain areas, indicating early-stage gum disease. Additionally, there is some recession on your lower left side, exposing part of the tooth root. 

The X-ray findings showed mild bone loss around your lower molars and an area of decay beneath your old filling, which could be contributing to your sensitivity and pain. It’s important that we address this issue soon to prevent further complications.

For your treatment, I recommend replacing the old filling and performing a deep cleaning to help with the gum inflammation. If the decay is not too deep, we can proceed with the filling replacement; however, if it has reached the pulp, a root canal may be necessary. We will monitor the tooth closely after the filling replacement. 

In the meantime, I suggest maintaining good oral hygiene by switching to an electric toothbrush and flossing daily. If you experience bleeding while flossing, it’s actually a sign that your gums need more care, so please continue to floss regularly. Reducing or quitting smoking will also significantly improve your gum health, as smoking is a major factor in the progression of gum disease.

Your next appointment is scheduled for next Wednesday, where we will proceed with the deep cleaning and filling replacement. In the meantime, please avoid very hot or cold foods and consider using a desensitizing toothpaste for comfort.

Please remember that your oral health is our top priority. If you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen, don’t hesitate to reach out to our office.

Best wishes for your continued dental health,
