      "So, Mr. Thompson, thanks for coming in today. What brings you in to see me? Well, Iâ€™ve been having some sensitivity in my lower left teeth, especially when drinking cold water. Also, I noticed some pain when chewing on that side. I see. And how long have you been experiencing this discomfort? It started maybe two or three weeks ago. At first, it was just occasional sensitivity, but now it's pretty consistent, especially with anything cold or crunchy. Okay. And any other symptoms, like swelling\n"

      "I appreciate you sharing your symptoms with us. Based on our consultation, you mentioned experiencing sensitivity in your lower left teeth, particularly when drinking cold water, as well as pain while chewing on that side. You noted that this discomfort started about two to three weeks ago and has become more consistent. Additionally, you reported some bleeding when brushing your teeth, mainly near your molars.\n",

Your gum probing scores indicated some inflammation, and I noticed some recession on your lower left side, which has exposed part of the tooth root. There is also an old composite filling on your lower left first molar, which you mentioned was placed about five or six years ago. When I tapped on your lower left tooth, you indicated that it was painful.\n",

      "The X-ray findings revealed mild bone loss around your lower molars and an area of decay beneath your old filling, which may be contributing to your sensitivity and pain. It’s important that we address this soon to prevent further complications.\n",

      "For your treatment, I recommend replacing the old filling and performing a deep cleaning to help with the gum inflammation. If the decay is not too deep, we can proceed with the filling replacement; however, if it has reached the pulp, a root canal may be necessary. We will monitor your tooth closely after the filling replacement. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also encourage you to improve your oral hygiene routine by switching to an electric toothbrush and incorporating daily flossing. If you experience bleeding while flossing, it’s a sign that your gums need more attention, and with time, they will become healthier. Additionally, reducing or quitting smoking will significantly benefit your gum health.\n",

      "I appreciate you sharing your symptoms with us. Based on our consultation, you have been experiencing sensitivity in your lower left teeth, particularly when drinking cold water, along with some pain while chewing on that side. You mentioned that this discomfort began about two to three weeks ago and has become more consistent, especially with cold or crunchy foods. Additionally, you noted some bleeding when brushing your teeth, primarily near your molars.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the examination, I observed some plaque buildup along your lower molars and mild gum inflammation. Your gum health indicated some recession on the lower left side, exposing part of the tooth root. When I tapped on your lower left molar, you reported some pain, which is concerning. The X-rays revealed mild bone loss around your lower molars and an area of decay beneath your old filling, which could be contributing to your sensitivity and discomfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address these issues, I recommend replacing the old filling and performing a deep cleaning to help with the gum inflammation. If the decay is not too deep, we can proceed with the filling replacement. However, if the decay has reached the pulp, a root canal may be necessary. We will monitor the tooth closely after the filling replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the treatment, I encourage you to improve your oral hygiene routine. Switching to an electric toothbrush and flossing daily will be beneficial. If you experience bleeding while flossing, it’s a sign that your gums need more attention, and with time, they should become healthier. Also, reducing or quitting smoking will significantly help improve your gum health, as smoking is a major factor in the progression of gum disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your next appointment is scheduled for next Wednesday, where we will proceed with the deep cleaning and filling replacement. In the meantime, please try to avoid very hot or cold foods and consider using a desensitizing toothpaste to help manage your sensitivity.\n",
