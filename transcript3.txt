Hi, Daniel. My name is Sarah. Nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today? Hi, Sarah. Nice to meet you too. I’ve noticed that my teeth have started shifting over the past couple of years, and my bottom teeth, in particular, are looking more crowded than before. Oh, I see. I’m sorry to hear that. How long have you been noticing these changes? It’s been happening gradually, but I’d say over the last two years it’s become more noticeable, especially when I see photos of myself. My dad actually has quite crooked teeth as well, so I’m worried mine are going the same way. Sure, Daniel. Well, let's go through a few questions before we take a look. Does that sound okay? Yeah, of course. Great. Do you take any medications or have any allergies? No, I don’t take any medication, and I don’t have any allergies. That’s good to hear. And do you smoke or drink alcohol? I don’t smoke, but I do drink socially—probably around five to ten units a week. Okay, that’s useful to note. And what do you do for work, if you don’t mind me asking? I’m a photographer, so I meet a lot of people, and I always want to present myself well. I’ve been feeling a bit self-conscious about my teeth recently, which is why I’m finally looking into it. That makes complete sense, Daniel. Well, let’s take a closer look. I’m going to sit the chair back now—just let me know if you’re comfortable. Yeah, all good. Perfect. So, examining your jaw externally, everything appears symmetrical. No issues with your TMJ, no clicking, and no swelling. Your lymph nodes feel fine as well. Now, inside your mouth, your lips, cheeks, tongue, floor of the mouth, and palate all look healthy, which is great. I can see that you have a small composite filling on the lower left five, which appears intact. Now, looking at your teeth, I can see the crowding you mentioned, especially on your lower front teeth, and there is some mild overlapping of the lower incisors. Your gum health is good, with BP scores of ones in a few areas but no significant concerns. Before discussing treatment, I’d like to take some X-rays to check your bone levels and assess the teeth alignment fully. Is that okay? Yeah, that’s fine. Also, just to confirm, there’s no chance that you might be undergoing any orthodontic treatment in the past, correct? No, I’ve never had braces before. Okay, good to know. So here’s your X-ray. It’s a grade A image, showing healthy bone levels, which is great news. There are no signs of decay, and your filling looks stable. However, I can see some minor crowding on your lower arch, and your upper central incisors have started to slightly shift forward. Based on this, we can confirm a diagnosis of mild lower anterior crowding and mild spacing in the upper front teeth. Let’s go through your options. The first option is to leave the teeth as they are. However, given your concerns, this may not be the best choice. The second option is traditional braces. These consist of metal brackets and wires to align your teeth gradually. They are very effective but may not be the most aesthetic solution for someone in a public-facing role. These typically cost around £2000 to £2500. The third option, which might suit you better, is clear aligners. These are a series of custom-made, removable trays that gradually straighten your teeth. They are nearly invisible, comfortable, and allow you to maintain your lifestyle without noticeable changes. Oh, that sounds interesting. I’ve heard of those before. Yes, they’re a popular choice for professionals like yourself. You wear them throughout the day and only remove them for eating and drinking. The cost for clear aligners is around £3500, but they provide a discreet and flexible way to achieve your desired result. That sounds perfect for me. I’d like to go with the clear aligners. Excellent choice. What we’ll do next is book an appointment for a digital scan of your teeth and a further assessment. This will allow us to plan your treatment and show you a preview of your expected results. I’ll also send you all the details to review at home. That sounds great, Sarah. Thank you so much. No problem at all, Daniel. We’ll see you next week! Have a great day. You too, thanks!
