So, Olivia, thanks for coming to see me today. What brings you into the clinic? Hi, doctor. So I’ve been having some discomfort with my top front teeth. They feel a bit loose, and I’ve also noticed some gaps forming that weren’t there before. It’s starting to make me a little self-conscious, so I wanted to see what can be done. Oh, I’m sorry to hear that, Olivia. When did you first start noticing this? I’d say over the past six months or so. I thought maybe I was imagining it at first, but now I can definitely see a change, and the looseness is becoming more obvious when I eat. Okay, I understand. We’ll take a closer look in just a moment, but before we do that, I’d like to ask you a few general health questions. Do you take any medications or have any allergies? No allergies. I do take levothyroxine for an underactive thyroid. Okay, and is that keeping everything stable for you? Yes, everything is fine with that. Great. And what about smoking or alcohol consumption? No smoking, but I do drink socially, maybe around six to eight units a week. Okay, and what do you do for work? I work as a teacher, so I’m speaking in front of students all day, and my confidence has been dipping a bit because of my teeth. I completely understand. Your smile is a big part of how you present yourself, so let’s figure out the best way forward for you. Let’s start by sitting the chair back and having a look. Sounds good. Perfect. So externally, I don’t notice any major issues. Your jaw joint seems fine—no clicking or discomfort? No, nothing like that. Okay, great. Inside your mouth, I can see that your gum health isn’t where we’d like it to be. There’s some inflammation and mild gum recession, particularly around your upper front teeth, which could explain the looseness you’ve been feeling. I also see some plaque buildup along the gumline, and your BP scores are mostly threes, with a couple of fours in the upper anterior region, which indicates moderate gum disease. Olivia, have you noticed any bleeding when you brush your teeth? Yes, quite often, actually, especially when I floss. That makes sense. What I’d like to do next is take some X-rays to check your bone levels and see what’s happening beneath the gums. Is that okay? Yes, absolutely. Perfect. So, looking at your X-rays now, I can see that there has been some bone loss around your upper front teeth. This is likely the reason for the movement you’ve been noticing. There’s no decay, which is good news, but we need to address the gum health issue before things progress further. Does that all make sense so far? Yes, that sounds serious. What can be done? Good question. So, we have a few treatment options. First, we need to focus on stabilizing your gum health. This means deep cleaning sessions to remove the plaque and bacteria causing the bone loss. If left untreated, this could continue, leading to further loosening of the teeth. We’ll need to monitor the results and see if the teeth stabilize. Does that sound okay to you? Yes, definitely. I want to do whatever I can to stop it from getting worse. Good. The second option to consider, if your teeth don’t stabilize after treatment, is using a splint—a thin wire bonded behind your teeth—to hold them in place. This would prevent further movement and give additional support. The final option, if the teeth become too loose in the future, would be considering a fixed replacement like implants or bridges, but that’s something we want to avoid if possible. That makes sense. I’d definitely prefer to keep my natural teeth. Absolutely. So let’s start with the deep cleaning, and we’ll review your progress over the next few months. I’ll also recommend using an electric toothbrush and a water flosser to help keep your gums as healthy as possible. That sounds good to me. I’ll do whatever I need to. Perfect. So we’ll book you in for your first deep cleaning session next week, and I’ll send you some aftercare instructions to help maintain your gum health in the meantime. Thank you so much, doctor. I really appreciate it. No problem at all, Olivia. We’ll see you next week!
