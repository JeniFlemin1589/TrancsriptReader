# Patient Follow-Up Letter Generator

## Overview

This project allows users to upload a consultation transcript in various formats (TXT, PDF, DOCX) and generate a personalized patient follow-up letter using OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The letter can be customized to different tones (empathetic, formal, casual) and is formatted for a professional look. This solution is built using **Streamlit**, **OpenAI's API**, and file management utilities.

## Features

- Upload transcripts in TXT, PDF, or DOCX formats.
- Extract text from the uploaded files.
- Generate a patient follow-up letter with various tones (empathetic, formal, casual).
- Format the letter with clinic branding and structure.
- Download the generated letter in `.txt` format.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/signup/)
- [Python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
- [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)
- [python-docx](https://pypi.org/project/python-docx/)

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/patient-follow-up-letter-generator.git
   cd patient-follow-up-letter-generator
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up OpenAI API key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     open_api_key=your_openai_api_key
     ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. The app will open in your browser. Upload a transcript file (TXT, PDF, DOCX) using the file uploader.

3. After uploading, the app will extract text from the file and use OpenAI's API to generate the patient follow-up letter.

4. Choose the tone of the letter (Empathetic, Formal, or Casual).

5. Once the letter is generated, you can view it and download it in `.txt` format.

## Project Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the main files and their roles in the project:

- **main.py**: The main entry point for the Streamlit app that handles file uploads and the letter generation process.
- **api_interaction.py**: Contains the logic for interacting with OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to generate the follow-up letter.
- **file_manager.py**: Manages file uploads and text extraction from various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
- **letter_formatter.py**: Adds clinic branding (header and footer) and formats the generated letter.
- **transcript_processor.py**: Loads and reads the transcript from the uploaded file.

## Example Workflow

1. The user uploads a transcript file (TXT, PDF, or DOCX).
2. The file is saved and its text content is extracted.
3. The extracted text is processed by the OpenAI API to generate a personalized patient follow-up letter.
4. The generated letter is formatted with clinic branding and tone preferences (empathetic, formal, casual).
5. The user can download the letter in `.txt` format.

## Environment Variables

- **open_api_key**: This is your OpenAI API key. It should be stored in a `.env` file for security.

Example `.env` file:
```
open_api_key=your_openai_api_key
```
