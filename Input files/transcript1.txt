So, Mr. Thompson, thanks for coming in today. What brings you in to see me? Well, I’ve been having some sensitivity in my lower left teeth, especially when drinking cold water. Also, I noticed some pain when chewing on that side. I see. And how long have you been experiencing this discomfort? It started maybe two or three weeks ago. At first, it was just occasional sensitivity, but now it's pretty consistent, especially with anything cold or crunchy. Okay. And any other symptoms, like swelling or bleeding gums? No swelling, but I have noticed a bit of bleeding when I brush my teeth, mostly near my molars. Got it. Before we take a look, let me ask you a few general questions. Are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies? No, nothing at all. Okay, that’s good to know. Do you smoke? Yeah, I do. How many per day, roughly? Probably around 15 to 20 cigarettes a day. All right. And what about alcohol consumption? I have a few drinks on the weekend, but nothing excessive. Okay. And what do you do for work? I’m a construction worker. That must be tough with tooth pain. Do you get a chance to maintain a regular oral hygiene routine? I try, but with early shifts and long hours, I sometimes miss brushing in the morning. I usually brush at night before bed, though. Okay. And do you use an electric or a manual toothbrush? Just a manual one. Do you floss regularly or use any other interdental cleaning tools? Not really. I’ve tried flossing before, but it made my gums bleed, so I stopped. That makes sense. Okay, let’s take a look. I’m going to recline the chair back. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Yeah, sure. All right. Looking at the outside of your mouth, everything seems normal. Inside, I can see some plaque buildup along your lower molars, and there’s some mild gum inflammation. There’s also an old composite filling on your lower left first molar. Do you remember when you had that done? Uh, probably five or six years ago. Okay. I’ll check your gums now. You might feel a little pressure as I probe around. Okay. I’m seeing BP scores of threes and fours in some areas, meaning there’s some gum inflammation. There’s also some recession on your lower left side, exposing part of the tooth root. And when I tap on your lower left six, does that feel painful? Yeah, a little bit. Understood. Based on what I see, you might have early-stage gum disease, along with some enamel wear on that lower left molar. Before making a final diagnosis, I’d like to take a couple of X-rays. Does that sound okay? Yeah, no problem. Great. Let’s take a look at the images now. So, from the X-rays, I can see some mild bone loss around your lower molars. There's also an area of decay under your old filling, which could be contributing to your sensitivity and pain. That doesn’t sound good. It’s definitely something we want to address soon before it worsens. The treatment options depend on how advanced the decay is. If it’s not too deep, we can remove the old filling and replace it with a new one. But if the decay has reached the pulp, a root canal might be necessary. Oh, okay. What do you recommend? I’d suggest replacing the filling first and monitoring the tooth. We’ll also do a deep cleaning to help with the gum inflammation. If symptoms persist, we’ll discuss further treatment options. That makes sense. I’ll also go over some oral hygiene tips. I recommend switching to an electric toothbrush and flossing daily. If flossing makes your gums bleed, it’s actually a sign that you need to floss more, not less. With time, your gums should adapt and become healthier. Got it. Since you smoke, reducing or quitting will also help improve your gum health. Smoking is a major factor in gum disease progression. Yeah, I’ve been meaning to cut back. That’s good to hear. Shall we go ahead and schedule your deep cleaning and filling replacement? Yeah, let’s do it. Great. We’ll book you in for next Wednesday. In the meantime, try to avoid very hot or cold foods and use a desensitizing toothpaste. Okay, will do. Thanks, doctor. No problem. We’ll see you next week!
