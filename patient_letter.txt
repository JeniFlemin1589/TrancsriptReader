Dear Mark,

Thank you for visiting our practice on your most recent visit. It was a pleasure meeting you and addressing your dental concerns.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:

- Main Symptoms: Crooked teeth, mild crowding in the lower front teeth, and a slight rotation on the upper right canine.
- Clinical Observations: Healthy gums with BP scores of zeros all around, a small composite filling on your upper right six which appears sound.
- X-ray Findings: Healthy bone levels, no signs of decay, mild to moderate crowding.

TREATMENT PLAN:

- Recommended Procedures: Clear aligners such as Invisalign, which are custom-made, removable trays that shift your teeth over time.
- Oral Hygiene Recommendations: Continue with your current oral hygiene routine as your gums and teeth are in good condition.
- Lifestyle Adjustments: No specific changes required at this time.

NEXT STEPS:

- Scheduled Appointment: We will book you in for your digital scan next week.
- Interim Advice: Continue with your current oral hygiene routine and monitor any changes in your teeth or gums.

Your oral health is our top priority, and we are committed to supporting you every step of the way. If you have any questions or experience worsening symptoms, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us.

Best wishes for your continued dental health,

Emma
