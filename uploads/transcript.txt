Hi, Mark. My name is Emma. Nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today? Hi, Emma. Nice to meet you too. I’ve been thinking about straightening my teeth for a while now. They’ve always been a little crooked, but I’ve only really started noticing it more in photos and when I talk. I wanted to find out if Invisalign or something similar could be an option for me. Absolutely, that’s a great question. How long have you been thinking about this? I’d say for the last couple of years, but I wasn’t sure about the options. I don’t want anything too invasive, like veneers, and I’d rather avoid metal braces since I have a lot of client meetings for work. That makes sense, Mark. We’ll definitely go through all your options and see what works best for you. Before we do that, I’d just like to ask a few general health questions. Do you have any medical conditions or take any medications? No, I’m in good health. No medications or allergies. That’s great. And do you smoke or drink alcohol? I don’t smoke, but I do have a few drinks on the weekends—probably around 5-7 units a week. Okay, thanks for sharing that. And what do you do for work? I work in finance, so I’m in front of people quite a bit, and I want to feel more confident when I’m speaking with clients. I completely understand, Mark. A confident smile can make a big difference, especially in a client-facing role. Now, let’s take a quick look at your teeth. I’m going to recline the chair back—let me know if you’re comfortable. Yeah, I’m good. Perfect. So, externally, I don’t notice any issues. Your jaw joint appears to be functioning well—no clicking or discomfort? No, no issues at all. Great. Inside your mouth, everything looks healthy. Your gums look good, with BP scores of zeros all around, which is excellent. You do have some mild crowding in the lower front teeth and a slight rotation on your upper right canine, which is likely what you’ve been noticing. I can also see a small composite filling on your upper right six, which appears sound. What I’d like to do next is take some X-rays just to check your bone levels and make sure there are no underlying concerns. Is that okay? Yes, of course. Great. So, looking at your X-rays, your bone levels are healthy, and there are no signs of decay, which is great news. The crowding we see is mild to moderate, which means clear aligners could be a very good option for you. Let’s go through your treatment options. The first option is conventional braces. These are the traditional metal brackets and wires that gradually move your teeth into place. They’re very effective, but as you mentioned, being public-facing might make this less ideal for you. They typically cost around £2000 for both arches. The second option is clear aligners, such as Invisalign. These are custom-made, removable trays that shift your teeth over time. They are nearly invisible and fit seamlessly into your lifestyle, as you only need to remove them when eating or drinking anything other than water. That sounds like what I’m looking for. Yes, they’re a great option for professionals. The treatment starts with a digital scan of your teeth, which allows us to create a custom plan for your alignment. Small, tooth-colored attachments may be placed on some teeth to assist with movement, and we provide you with chewies to help the aligners seat properly. You’d need to wear them for 22 hours a day, changing them every one to two weeks as directed. The cost for clear aligners is around £3000, but they provide a discreet and comfortable way to achieve your desired results. That sounds perfect. I’d like to go ahead with the clear aligners. Excellent. The next step is to book you in for your digital scan so we can start planning your treatment. Once we have the scan, we’ll go through your ClinCheck, which is a 3D simulation of your treatment plan. How does that sound? That sounds great, thank you. No problem at all, Mark. We’ll get you booked in for next week, and I’ll send over all the details for you to review at home. Looking forward to it. Thanks, Emma! You’re very welcome. See you soon!
